The scripts in the package are used to add new machines to the Vector Space network and to install and maintain software across the network.

These scripts have been tested on Mint and Manjaro.

* Adding a new machine
After installing the OS on the target machine, clone this repository to the target machine.

Change the user name in the *.yml files

$ add_client.sh
This will install and enable ssh as well as the VS public key. It will also run an Ansible playbook to install NIS.

$ sudo install_software.sh


* Maintaining existing machines
$ sudo install_software.sh
